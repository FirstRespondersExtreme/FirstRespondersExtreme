-The required score for each difficulty has now been changed to 40, 60, 80, 100.

--In addition, each difficulty is now titled after their respective damage modifiers, meaning you will absorb more damage in easier difficulties and less damage in harder difficulties.

---Down below is a visual representation to help you understand this.

Damage_Modifier_0.1x --------------------> Required Score: 40

Damage_Modifier_0.2x --------------------> Required Score: 60

Damage_Modifier_0.3x --------------------> Required Score: 80

IMPOSSIBLE ----------------------------------> Required Score: 100

-Added low-resolution support for both 576p and 480p.
--576p is working as intended, no missing text.
---480p has some missing text (affecting some equipment, options, and gameplay text) but gameplay is still 100% playable.
