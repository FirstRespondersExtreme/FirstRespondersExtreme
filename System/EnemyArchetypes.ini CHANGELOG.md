-ALL SUSPECTS WILL NOW HAVE THESE SETTINGS ENABLED

--Wanders=True
---COPIED FROM SEF: Added wandering characters! By setting Wanders=True in an archetype… …, it will choose patrol points randomly instead of in a fixed order, providing a somewhat believable 'living' area.

--Insane=True
---By making all suspects Insane, your A.I. squadmates will be more likely to shoot suspects on sight, rather than yelling at them first.

-ALL CUSTOM SUSPECTS (at least the ones with "FriendlyName=" attached) will now always investigate, and will never barricade.
--In addition, they will all carry gas masks, and they will have a LEVEL IV body armor hidden under their clothes, meaning even though they may appear unarmored, their chests are practically immune to your bullets.
