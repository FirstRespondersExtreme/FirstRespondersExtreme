-CacheSizeMegs has been lowered to 32, to increase stability and lower system requirements.
--Apparently, putting CacheSizeMegs at 64 improved reactions time with the A.I. and made the game more responsive.
---This may be true, but it has also increased crashes and FPS drops (at CacheSizeMegs=64) so I am lowering it down to 32.

-The Windowed Mode size has been defaulted at (1600x900).
