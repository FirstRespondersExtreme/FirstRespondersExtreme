-The themes for the main menu, settings, and credits have all been changed with SEF counterparts.

--The main menu theme now uses the "calm" version of the Brewer County Courthouse.
---This can be found in "[ui_MusicDefault]"

----The themes for the settings and the credits use the "dynamic" version of the Meat Barn Restaurant (Packing Area) (DISCLAIMER: There are multiple "calm" and "dynamic" versions of the Meat Barn Restaurant when in different parts of said map).
-----This can be found in "[ui_MusicSettings]" and "[ui_MusicCredits]"

------The "calm" version of "The Wolcott Projects" + "Old Granite Hotel" + "Department of Agriculture" has been changed entirely, to match the more active pacing of the mod.
-------This can be found in "[m11Arms1]" + "[m12HotelA]" + "[expm04Office1]"

--------The fire alarm sound effect for the "Old Granite Hotel" has been removed, meaning while the fire alarm will still have a light attached, no sound will come out of it.
---------This can be found in "[AmbientSoundStarted_a12Alarm_SP]" and "[AmbientSoundStarted_a12Alarm_MP]"

----------The downed sounds for both "MALEBULGARIAN1" and "MALEBULGARIAN2" have been reduced by 50%.
