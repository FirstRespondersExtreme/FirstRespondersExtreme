-All bonuses have been either removed and/or set to 0.
--This means you no longer need to report to TOC and/or secure evidence.
---This also means that you no longer need to worry about civilians/officers being injured in order to receive the best score possible.
----The new system only focuses on arresting, incapacitating, and killing suspects, all being done at 100% maximum.

-Arresting suspects gives a 1.0 ratio for each suspect arrested, meaning if you play a map with 10 suspects, and arrest every single one of them, you get a 100%.
--Incapacitating suspects gives a 0.7 ratio for each suspect incapacitated, meaning if you play a map with 10 suspects, and incapacitate every single one of them, you get a 70%.
---Killing suspects gives a 0.4 ratio for each suspect killed, meaning if you play a map with 10 suspects, and kill every single one of them, you get a 40%.
---- Keep in mind, incapacitating half of the suspects and killing the other half will give you a score between 40% and 70%.

The good news about this system is that this new system I created scores based upon the number of suspects in the map, meaning maps with less suspects will be graded more strongly than maps with 99+ suspects.

This also means that all of the maps provided to you will now have a consistent level of difficulty, as maps with higher suspects will allow you to get away with more incapacitating/killing than maps with less suspects provided.

-Lastly, ALMOST all penalties have been removed from the game.
--The only penalty that remains is the "Incapacitated Officer" penalty, which has been reduced from (-25) to (-1).
---The "Incapacitated Officer" penalty was kept in so that AI Permadeath campaign would not break (as removing this penalty means that the game no longer gives you AI Permadeath even when selected).
