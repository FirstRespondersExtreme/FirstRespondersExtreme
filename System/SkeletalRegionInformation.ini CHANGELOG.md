-This .ini change makes it where all shots can't cripple and inaccurate you.

--In addition, every part of your body receives the same damage effect of 0.5.

---This means that headshots, bodyshots, armshots, and legshots do the same amount of damage to you and other people.

----For example, with the .ini file implanted, the Glock 17 (with JHP rounds) will incapacitate in 3 shots, no matter the body part.
-----This is different than every other mod, in where different weapons will do different damage to different body parts.
